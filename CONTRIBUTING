CONTRIBUTING

If you want to contribute but are not sure what needs doing, see the issue:

  https://github.com/LeamHall/book_collate/issues

If you see something larger that needs work, but isn't yet an issue, please
create an issue tracker and we can talk about it. 

Here are some general guidelines

  Stay with the Perl Standard Library as much as possible.
   - Pure Perl, no XS.

  Pull requests rather than patches. 
   - Please add an entry for each change in Changes as well.

  Tests, using Test::More.
   - No tests, no code.
